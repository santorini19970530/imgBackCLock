# Image Background CLock
### varies with hours

This is my second task that make the webpage shows only time with styled.

Background and style varies by hours.
I just need to set up two different style sets, then let javascript selects (if-else) which style to be used.
Remember to place the jpg files into **/images/ forder** before use.

Still I am messy on CSS styling, and I will keep hard-working on this.

The photos were token by me during my Japan travel.
One is the view stending onto Wakayama Castle, another one in JR West Suma Station. Both are good place for travel.
You may feel free to use.
